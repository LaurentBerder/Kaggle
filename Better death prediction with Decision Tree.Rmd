What I'm doing here is trying to predict whether a character is dead or alive.

First things first, let's load some necessary packages and the **character-predictions** file
```{r library, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(data.table)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(plotly)
library(rpart)

predictions<-fread("../input/character-predictions.csv",stringsAsFactors=TRUE)
```

# First run
#### Separation
We need to learn on a training sample, and I'm going for a sample of 40% the size of the original file.
```{r sampling}
training <- predictions[sample(nrow(predictions), floor(nrow(predictions) * 0.4)), ]
```

#### Decision tree
On this training sample, I'm running a Decision Tree to compare the current **isAlive** status of each characters and all the variables I believe are relevant for a prediction, such as:

* Date of birth
* Culture
* House
* Gender
* Whether character's mother is still alive
* Whether character's father is still alive
* Whether character's children are still alive
* Whether character's spouse is still alive
* Whether character is married
* Whether character is noble
* Whether character is popular

```{r Decision Tree}
fit<-rpart(isAlive ~ dateOfBirth + culture + house + male + isAliveMother + isAliveFather + isAliveHeir + isAliveSpouse + isMarried + isNoble + isPopular, data = training, method="class")
```
#### Prediction
This gives us a set of rules that we can apply to the whole file to come up with a boolean prediction on the character's fate.
```{r prediction}
predictions$myprediction<-as.integer(predict(fit, predictions, type = "class"))
predictions$myprediction[predictions$myprediction==1]<-0
predictions$myprediction[predictions$myprediction==2]<-1
```
I'm then assigning a score to each of my predictions and previously existing predictions, based on the comparison with the characters' current condition.
```{r score}
predictions$myscore<-ifelse(predictions$isAlive==predictions$myprediction, "OK", ifelse(predictions$isAlive<predictions$myprediction, "Should be dead", "Should be alive"))
predictions$predscore<-ifelse(predictions$isAlive==predictions$pred, "OK", ifelse(predictions$isAlive<predictions$pred, "Should be dead", "Should be alive"))
```

#### Comparison with previously existing one
This time, what I'm doing is comparing the scores for both predictors.
```{r comparison}
scores<-group_by(select(predictions,c(myscore,predscore)),myscore, predscore) %>% summarise(n=n())

scores$myscore<-factor(scores$myscore, levels=c("Should be dead","OK", "Should be alive"))
scores$predscore<-factor(scores$predscore, levels=c("Should be dead","OK", "Should be alive"))
scores<-arrange(scores, myscore, predscore)

plot_ly(data=scores, x=myscore, y=predscore, size=n, type = "scatter", mode="markers") %>%
  layout(title="Comparison of my prediction scores with the provided 'pred'")
```
As you can see, both predictions are rather accurate, mostly falling in the OK category.

It seems like my predictor is a little more optimistic (often predicting a character's survival while he/she died in horrible pain), while the previous prediction was more pessimistic.

On the global view, however, we can see that my prediction has a slightly better achievement: the middle column shows larger bubbles than the middle row.



But this is based on a random sample as a first step, which may have had an impact on the results. I'm therefore going to reproduce this a few times to have a more trustworthy comparison on the long run.

# Repeating the process
I need to prepare the dataframe that will receive the results.
```{r preparation}
predbetter<-vector()
mybetter<-vector()
bothgood<-vector()
bothwrong<-vector()
results<-data.frame(cbind(predbetter,mybetter,bothgood,bothwrong))
rm(predbetter,mybetter,bothgood,bothwrong)
```
Then I run the loop 100 times before I compare the results.
```{r loop}
for (i in 1:100)
{
  training <- predictions[sample(nrow(predictions), floor(nrow(predictions) * 0.4)), ]
  fit<-rpart(isAlive ~ dateOfBirth + culture + house + male + isAliveMother + isAliveFather + isAliveHeir + isAliveSpouse + isMarried + isNoble + isPopular, data = training, method="class")
  
  predictions$myprediction<-as.integer(predict(fit, predictions, type = "class"))
  predictions$myprediction[predictions$myprediction==1]<-0
  predictions$myprediction[predictions$myprediction==2]<-1
  
  predictions$myscore<-ifelse(predictions$isAlive==predictions$myprediction, "OK", ifelse(predictions$isAlive<predictions$myprediction, "Should be dead", "Should be alive"))
  predictions$predscore<-ifelse(predictions$isAlive==predictions$pred, "OK", ifelse(predictions$isAlive<predictions$pred, "Should be dead", "Should be alive"))
  
  scores<-group_by(select(predictions,c(myscore,predscore)),myscore, predscore) %>% summarise(n=n()) %>% spread(myscore,n)
  
  results[i,1]<-sum(scores[1,3:4], na.rm = TRUE)
  results[i,2]<-sum(scores[2:3,2], na.rm = TRUE)
  results[i,3]<-scores[1,2]
  results[i,4]<-sum(scores[2:3,3:4],na.rm = TRUE)
}

plot_ly(data=results, y=predbetter ,type="box", name="Better results with\nprevious prediction") %>%
  add_trace(data=results, y=mybetter, type="box", name="Better results\nwith my prediction") %>%
  add_trace(data=results, y=bothwrong, type="box", name="Both predictions are wrong") %>%
  add_trace(data=results, y=bothgood, type="box", name="Both predictions are good") %>%
  layout(title="Comparison of prediction results over 100 runs", showlegend=FALSE, yaxis=list(title=""))
  ```
  I encourage you to zoom on the plot to better see the detail of the 3 first boxes, as (I mentioned this already) the **"Both predictions are good"** results are so much of a majority that it makes the plot hard to read.
  
  You can see that the lowest category is the **"Better results with previous prediction"**, slightly common than **"Both predictions are wrong"**.
  
  **"Better results\nwith my prediction"**, however clearly shows itself to be ahead.
